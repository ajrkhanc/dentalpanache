               After the procedure of Tooth Extraction in Gurgaon, a cotton swab is put at the place of the tooth and you’re requested to bite down on it and apply pressure for 40 minutes to halt the bleeding. Whenever the teeth are removed surgically, you’ll have stitches and a gauze packing inside your mouth. Avoid anything hot, hard or spicy during the first 24 hours of extraction. Excessive spitting or talking is not allowed and cold packs are recommended. Warm saline rinses are started after 24 hours (7-8 times during the day) to expedite healing and stitches are removed after 7 days. The procedure of Tooth Extraction in Gurgaon is a routine procedure, and the danger of complications is practically negligible. Soring of the jaw, bruising and any other kind of swelling after the removal is deemed to be normal. Tooth lost due to any reason should be replaced immediately or as soon as possible to maintain bone integrity, preserve aesthetics, prevent drifting of neighbouring teeth & super-eruption of opposing teeth thereby resulting in loss of chewing efficiency. Please consult us for suitable treatment planning and execution.

               <h5 class="headingh5 mmt-20">Wisdom Tooth Extraction</h5>
               <p class="text-justify">
               Wisdom teeth, or third molars, usually erupt between 17-25 years of age. In some cases, they do not appear, they erupt uneventfully in a few while they erupt at an angle damaging adjacent tooth/bone in many cases. They may be partially or completely covered by gums or bone until they appear in the mouth. Impacted wisdom teeth are dreadful and can induce decay in surrounding teeth if they’re not removed. Difficulty in brushing may lead to accumulation of food and bacteria between the tooth and gum flap leading to pain, infection and inflammation called PERICORONITIS. Antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, painkillers and warm saline rinses are given as a first line of treatment. If symptoms do not subside or recur frequently, removal of the wisdom tooth is advised. The impacted wisdom teeth are broken up into various categories, dependent on the alignment of the tooth. In the event the tooth has not erupted yet and there’s a swelling, then there is most likely a cyst present at the base of the tooth.
