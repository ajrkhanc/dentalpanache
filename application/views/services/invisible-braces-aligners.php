              We know smiling increases your face value and we can help you attain your desired smile without social inhibitions. The newest in the block is CLEAR ALIGNERS, <b>invisible braces in Gurgaon,</b> the hidden way to straighten your teeth without traditional braces. It uses a series of custom-made clear medical grade plastic aligners fabricated with our expertise and 3D computer imaging software. The treatment consists of set of plastic trays which needs to be changed every 2 weeks and with each replacement, you can virtually visualize the minor tooth movements and monitor your own progress. The frequency of visits to the dental office for the treatment of <b>invisible braces in Gurgaon</b> is only once in 4-6 weeks to monitor the progress which is much less in comparison to conventional treatment. They are removable for eating and drinking, for important photo moments, such as weddings and graduations. Proper case selection and treatment planning are paramount for desirable results. Total treatment time averages 10-30 months and the average number of aligners during treatment is between 8-30 depending on the case.

               <p class="text-justify">
               After the orthodontist has realigned the teeth, a RETAINER is mandatory to prevent the teeth to move back towards their original positions. Some amount of relapse is inevitable, but retainers are generally worn until the underlying bone has reformed into the correct tooth position. Some retainers are removable while others are bonded on the underside of teeth.
