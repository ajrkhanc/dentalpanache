               <h3 class="headingh4">Dental Implants and The Importance Of Replacing Your Damaged or Missing Teeth</h3>            
               <p class="text-justify">
               Dental implants are a common dental procedure, but a lot of people feel sceptical about getting them. It is natural that you might feel tensed about the procedure, but when you know all the details it becomes a lot easier.
               </p>
               <p class="text-justify">
               A dental implant is a tiny but very strong titanium alloy screw that is used to surgically replace damaged, missing, or diseased tooth/ teeth. They are usually drilled into the jawbone, so that the screw can firmly connect the artificial tooth or any other dental prosthetics to the jaw.

               When a single tooth is lost, the balance of the entire dental structure is disturbed.

               Over a period of time this shifting and tilting may cause various dental problems, especially if the distorted structure of the teeth interferes with the patient’s chewing abilities. There are high chances that one might lose multiple teeth over the course of years as a result of one missing tooth not being replaced and it may even cause bone loss in the same row side by side.

               If all your teeth are intact, then you might have never experienced the pain and discomfort of a food particle being lodged in your tooth or when it comes in between the exposed root of the missing molar and an existing one.
               </p>
